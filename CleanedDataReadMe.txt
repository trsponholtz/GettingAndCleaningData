Data were made available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Briefly, the data contains measurements made on a total of 30 subjects performing 6 activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, standing, sitting, and laying. 

Measurements were made using the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy II smartphone worn at the hip by the participants. The participants were split into training

and testing datasets in a 70%:30% ratio. Details of the measurements taken and initial processing are available in the metadata contained in the zip file and at
